# Adafruit FT232H Microservice

This project provides a lightweight REST API around the Adafruit FT232H device's Python libraries.
This allows other applications (which may be written in other languages like C++) to very simply
access GPIO, I2C, and SPI devices without needing to be tightly coupled to the Adafruit FT232H
Python code.
